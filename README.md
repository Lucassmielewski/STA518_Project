# STA518 Project Proposal 

This project will be centered around developing an interactive R-Shiny App. The details on the application are yet to be determined, but the intitial project will consist of scraping MLB data from sites such as Baseball References, Fangraphs, and MLB Savant. This Shiny App will not most likely include predictive models or inferential statistics, but will used to created visually pleasing graphical summaries of team or player related descriptive statistics. It may involve a chloropleth map of the proportion/quantity of Major League players from various countries and states. In this case the user would be able to select numerous grouping variables such as position group, age, or perfomance based metrics to narrow the results to only their selections. Another route may involve run expectancy calculations where the user would be able to select a combination of situational variables like inning, outs, position of runners on base, balls, strikes, etc. and recieve a probability distribution of the number of runs the team is expected to score in said inning. 
Conducting this project will greatly expand my understanding of R as it will not only introduce me to R-Shiny apps, but also reinforce many other areas such as Web-scraping, Data Manipulation, writing iterative functions, producing grahphical summaries of data, and most likely many other tools and techniques along the way.
